# Prediction of Adult Census Income dataset using different classification models

In this project, We have performed a detailed comparison of 12 different classification models
for the Adult Census Income dataset to predict whether a person's income is over 50000 USD
or not. We have used 12 different classification models and performed different preprocessing
techniques on the dataset and hyperparameter tuning for the models to further improve the
accuracy in the prediction of labels mentioned.

We have observed 86% overall accuracy for default values and improvement of over 2% (88.3%
overall accuracy) after the optimization of the models. The results of the experiments show that
a similar set of preprocessing and classification models can be used for comparing many
prediction problems similar to the one presented in the project.
